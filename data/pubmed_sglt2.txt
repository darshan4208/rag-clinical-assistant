Abstract:
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a class of glucose-lowering agents that reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.  

Meta-analysis of major cardiovascular outcome trials (EMPA-REG, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58) showed a significant reduction in heart failure hospitalization and progression of kidney disease.  

The cardioprotective effects appear independent of glucose lowering, suggesting potential benefit in patients without diabetes as well.
